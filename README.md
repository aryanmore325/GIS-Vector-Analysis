GIS-Enhanced Traffic Routing and Multi-Modal Transport Analysis

Overview

This project leverages Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and vector data analysis to analyze traffic patterns, recommend optimal routes, and support various transportation modes such as walking, biking, and public transit. It aims to simplify route planning while considering real-time traffic conditions.

Objectives

Traffic Analysis: Identify congested areas using real-time or historical traffic data.

Optimal Routing: Suggest the best routes to a destination based on traffic and mode of transport.

Multi-Modal Transport Support: Provide routing options for walking, biking, buses, and other transport modes.

Interactive Visualization: Visualize traffic patterns, routes, and congestion on a dynamic map.

Features

Real-time traffic data integration.

Multi-modal route recommendations.

Traffic density analysis using vector data.

Interactive map with visual overlays for congestion and route options.

Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

GeoPandas

Folium

Matplotlib/Plotly for visualization

NetworkX for routing

Pandas for data analysis

Data Formats: GeoJSON, Shapefiles

Data Sources: OpenStreetMap, Google Maps API (or similar traffic APIs)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd GIS-Enhanced-Traffic-Routing

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Import the necessary libraries in your Python script or notebook.

Load the required traffic and vector data.

Execute the analysis script to generate route recommendations.

Launch the interactive map to visualize the results.

Example Workflow

Load vector data (roads, transport networks) and traffic datasets.

Perform traffic density analysis using GIS tools.

Use NetworkX to calculate shortest paths for various transport modes.

Visualize the results using Folium or Plotly.

Future Enhancements

Incorporate machine learning for traffic prediction.

Expand transport modes to include carpooling or ride-sharing.

Add user customization for route preferences (e.g., scenic routes, toll-free roads).
